     <p>



        “Adults Swim” is the seventh track on Ski Mask’s self-titled album, STOKELEY. Ski posted a video of himself freestyling the lyrics over an ukelele in August 2018, and the full song was released in late November 2018.







The title references the adult-oriented programming block on the Cartoon Network programming show “Adult Swim” that broadcasts shows such as Rick and Morty, which he frequently references in his music.

      Yeah, yeah, common sense is to compromise



When everybody 'round you talking nice



That is a yes man, recognize



Yeah, uh, I am appalled by the battles I fight



I let them all think a n***a too nice



Like when a n***a say his dog don't bite



Yeah, uh, I shake s**t like a lime in a coconut



Smoking dark green weed, my b***h call it ogre nut



Forbidden fruit in my diet, get your wisdom up



Yeah, huh, I'm like shucks, s**t, shawty got a big butt



Clout is a hell of a drug, that's why she give suck



Bitch, I think I'm MC and Hammer because you can't touch



Ooh, what you do?



Pour the Henny like a soup (Uh)



Psst, black lagoon, where I'm from, animal



Nickelodeon, with my slimes, let 'em ooze



Like when Stella, bought Margiela, I got back my groove



You is a square like in a Rubik's



All on my d**k like the hair on my pubic



She said, she ready, look at her stupid



'Cause she got a diaper booty like Cupid



Water how I move, liquid, let's do it



Money how I talk, b***h, I speak fluent



Smokin' on stank, you smell like a sewer



How was you feeling, vro? B***h, like the Four











Like haiku, I speak smooth (Ooh)



But they tryna f**k up my mood (Ooh)



Thought we cool, but when you round (Ooh)



You fuck up the cool in my mood (Ooh)



Like say moo, black white fur



Designer jacket cover my nude, uh



Take it serious, that's it period (That's it)



Don't f**k up my groove (That's it, that's it)



Like haiku, I speak smooth (Ooh)



But they tryna f**k up my mood (Ooh)



Thought we cool, but when you round (Ooh)



You f**k up the cool in my mood (Ooh)



Like say moo, black white fur



Designer jacket cover my nude, uh



Take it serious, that's it period (Ooh)



Don't f**k up my groove (Yeah)
