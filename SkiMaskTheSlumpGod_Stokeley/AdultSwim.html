      Yeah, yeah, common sense is to compromise
When everybody 'round you talking nice
That is a yes man, recognize
Yeah, uh, I am appalled by the battles I fight
I let them all think a n***a too nice
Like when a n***a say his dog don't bite
Yeah, uh, I shake s**t like a lime in a coconut
Smoking dark green weed, my b***h call it ogre nut
Forbidden fruit in my diet, get your wisdom up
Yeah, huh, I'm like shucks, s**t, shawty got a big butt
Clout is a hell of a drug, that's why she give suck
Bitch, I think I'm MC and Hammer because you can't touch
Ooh, what you do?
Pour the Henny like a soup (Uh)
Psst, black lagoon, where I'm from, animal
Nickelodeon, with my slimes, let 'em ooze
Like when Stella, bought Margiela, I got back my groove
You is a square like in a Rubik's
All on my d**k like the hair on my pubic
She said, she ready, look at her stupid
'Cause she got a diaper booty like Cupid
Water how I move, liquid, let's do it
Money how I talk, b***h, I speak fluent
Smokin' on stank, you smell like a sewer
How was you feeling, vro? B***h, like the Four


Like haiku, I speak smooth (Ooh)
But they tryna f**k up my mood (Ooh)
Thought we cool, but when you round (Ooh)
You fuck up the cool in my mood (Ooh)
Like say moo, black white fur
Designer jacket cover my nude, uh
Take it serious, that's it period (That's it)
Don't f**k up my groove (That's it, that's it)
