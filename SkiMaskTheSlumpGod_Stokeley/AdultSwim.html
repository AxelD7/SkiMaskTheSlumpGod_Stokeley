        “Adults Swim” is the seventh track on Ski Mask’s self-titled album, STOKELEY. Ski posted a video of himself freestyling the lyrics over an ukelele in August 2018, and the full song was released in late November 2018.



The title references the adult-oriented programming block on the Cartoon Network programming show “Adult Swim” that broadcasts shows such as Rick and Morty, which he frequently references in his music.

      Yeah, yeah, common sense is to compromise

When everybody 'round you talking nice

That is a yes man, recognize

Yeah, uh, I am appalled by the battles I fight

I let them all think a n***a too nice

Like when a n***a say his dog don't bite

Yeah, uh, I shake s**t like a lime in a coconut

Smoking dark green weed, my b***h call it ogre nut

Forbidden fruit in my diet, get your wisdom up

Yeah, huh, I'm like shucks, s**t, shawty got a big butt

Clout is a hell of a drug, that's why she give suck

Bitch, I think I'm MC and Hammer because you can't touch

Ooh, what you do?

Pour the Henny like a soup (Uh)

Psst, black lagoon, where I'm from, animal

Nickelodeon, with my slimes, let 'em ooze

Like when Stella, bought Margiela, I got back my groove

You is a square like in a Rubik's

All on my d**k like the hair on my pubic

She said, she ready, look at her stupid

'Cause she got a diaper booty like Cupid

Water how I move, liquid, let's do it

Money how I talk, b***h, I speak fluent

Smokin' on stank, you smell like a sewer

How was you feeling, vro? B***h, like the Four





Like haiku, I speak smooth (Ooh)

But they tryna f**k up my mood (Ooh)

Thought we cool, but when you round (Ooh)

You fuck up the cool in my mood (Ooh)

Like say moo, black white fur

Designer jacket cover my nude, uh

Take it serious, that's it period (That's it)

Don't f**k up my groove (That's it, that's it)

Like haiku, I speak smooth (Ooh)

But they tryna f**k up my mood (Ooh)

Thought we cool, but when you round (Ooh)

You f**k up the cool in my mood (Ooh)

Like say moo, black white fur

Designer jacket cover my nude, uh

Take it serious, that's it period (Ooh)

Don't f**k up my groove (Yeah)
