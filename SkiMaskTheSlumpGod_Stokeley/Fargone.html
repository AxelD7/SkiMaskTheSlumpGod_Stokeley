Hah, yah, hah
Murda
Yuh, huh
Are you feeling me?
Can you feel it, aye?
I been lost for days, stuck in my brain
Like reptilian, cold heart that I'm carrying
Fell off with every man, tryna give me brain
No it's not up for debate
Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye
'Cause I know there is no escape
Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye
Like a dinner a lot on my plate
Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye
I'm trapped in my mind on a date
Aye, aye, aye
Can we race?
Lamb talk, she wanna marry like Kate, uh
It be hard for me to make a bitch date, uh
I've been focused, I'm so grown, I don't like to wait, uh
Tall grass, yes I know around me be some snakes, uh
Haul ass always movin' so I like to pace
Soulja Boy, I tell them that they out of date, uh
Instinct animal bitch, yes I hibernate
Chucky doll told them, bitch, yes come out and play
Um so to say, Transformer I'm Bumblebee
Wish I really was Decepticon
But I don't got no evil in me
Can't comprehend what you say
That girl always on her knees
So like an episode of SpongeBob
That bitch be like no way
No it's not up for debate
Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye
'Cause I know there is no escape
Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye
Like a dinner a lot on my plate
Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye
I'm trapped in my mind on a date
Aye, aye, aye (oh, oh)
I've been waitin', hard vacay
Will you hold my hand in the rain?
Feel misconstrued and confused
Like a wild toucan in the zoo
Oh, sensei
How I've been kicking shit, feel like Bruce Lee, uh
Youngest fucking flexer, no Lil Tay, uh
I get brain like a fool, jar of mayonnaise
I say aye, like okay take out on cake

One Punch in the pussy, like an anime
A1 Sauce no steak
Okay, hit it on low, foot brake
Didn't know her name
Chilling in the hills, LA
Uhm, are you feeling me?
Can you feel it, aye?
I been lost for days, stuck in my brain

Fell off with every man, tryna give me brain

'Cause know there is no escape
Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye
Like a dinner a lot on my plate
Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye
I'm trapped in my mind on a date
Aye, aye, aye
I've been up for days I've been goin' crazy
Only sex in bed, it's okay (it's okay)
This another wave, bought another chain
Bought another ring, I'm on fleek (I'm on fleek)
This ain't Lil Xan I got hits for days
Every time they play, they press repeat (press repeat)
We tote sticks for real, not for Instagram
When the pressure on we gon' eat (We gon' eat)
I gotta stick to the code
I can't switch it up too much I'm a goat
These boys for real I ain't sellin' my soul
I pop an addy and hop in the ghost and pou' me a fou'
Scroll on the gram tryna catch me a hoe
They listen, know when I speak I'm the pope
I'm the one still in the streets, give 'em hope
Never turn on 'em my niggas dem no
Are you feeling me?
Can you feel it, aye?
I been lost for days, stuck in my brain
Like reptilian, cold heart that I'm carrying
Fell off with every man, tryna give me brain
No it's not up for debate

'Cause know there is no escape
Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye
Like a dinner a lot on my plate
Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye
