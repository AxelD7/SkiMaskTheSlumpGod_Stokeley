        Ski Mask The Slump God - Reborn to Rebel

        Ayy (uhh)
N-O (haha)
Hell no (ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay)
Yuh, yuh, yuh, uh (ayy)
I met the devil, my soul I'm not selling but hello
Run armageddon, your soul are you selling? N-O
Snorlax, I'm lazy, come tickle me baby, Elmo
Let's start a riot, f**k if you tired, yell out
I don't care if you don't care, we don't
I don't care if you don't care, we don't
Life ain't fair, we ain't scared, we know
I don't care if you don't care, we don't
And for us to survive we need to uprise our people (yup)
Must sanitize the thought of demise, of freedom (yup)
Like Allstate, you're in good hands with me though
Taking our children they got us searchin' like for Nemo (yuh)
I won't take no s**t from the government (ah, woah!)
They been had plans for this, wasn't suddenly (ah, woah!)
And any time I can, I take the system's hand and crumble it
Whenever you can make a difference, yell it out, don't mumble it
I distract myself from the world, to stay in my element
The heart I carry takes on the weight of good people's negligence
So if the government don't give a s**t you can't stay mad again
Cause we already feel the same way about how they handle s**t
Uh, I met the devil, my soul I'm not selling but hello (Hello)
Run armageddon, your soul are you selling? N-O (N-O)
Snorlax, I'm lazy, come tickle me baby, Elmo (Elmo)
Let's start a riot, f**k if you tired, yell out (yuh, yuh, yuh, yuh, yuh)
I don't care if you don't care, we don't (grrr)
I don't care if you don't care, we don't (grrr)
Life ain't fair, we ain't scared, we know
I don't care if you don't care, we don't
Yes, this is a new peacoat, and I paid my taxes
Like Carmelo with the free throw, on they a** like grass
I may seem flyer than a seagull, Harry Potter glasses
Cleaning Stanley Steamer steam hoe, call me Ski no snow slope
Humanity sucks, humanity blows, no cello
No hablo Espa√±ol, but dinero
Drop my top, JFK, leggo
They wanna link and try to build, Lego's
Hold on to something, I am eruptin'
It's a destruction, sons of the anarchy
Bust up teeth for my lunch b***h, with no discussion
This is disgustin', fake it to make it you
I met the devil, my soul I'm not selling but hello
Run armageddon, your soul are you selling? N-O
Snorlax, I'm lazy, come tickle me baby, Elmo
Let's start a riot, f**k if you tired, yell out
I don't care if you don't care, we don't
I don't care if you don't care, we don't
Life ain't fair, we ain't scared, we know
I don't care if you don't care, we don't
(We don't, we don't, we don't, we don't)
