        Yeah, aye
Hold on, babe
Yeah, aye
The Pharmacy
Hold on, babe
Yeah, aye
Hold on, babe
Got some habits, I can't keep them
The same ones that made you hate me
Ho-oh, smokin' potent, high as nose hair
If I were to get lost, bitch would you save me?
Baby would you save me?
Oh, baby would you save me?
(Yeah aye, hold on, babe)
Been thinkin' bout it lately
Oh, thinkin' bout it lately
(Yeah aye, hold on, babe)
Baby would you save me?
Oh, baby, baby, baby
(Yeah aye, hold on, babe)
Been thinkin' bout it lately
Oh, baby, baby, baby
Sons, daughters, wives, lives all lost in the name that love that died
Mary Jane replacement for any bitch that kill my vibe
I'm hot as fuck like cast a spell
(Yeah aye, hold on, babe)
The village people couldn't even burn me alive
Bad habits, live fast, die young, fully aware of the power inside
(Yeah aye, hold on, babe)
Don't really be going outside
(Yeah aye, hold on, babe)
Got my own amenities on my side
You know that every club won't let me inside (yeah aye, hol' up, aye)
(Yeah aye, hold on, babe)
Like Pinocchio can never tell a lie
And yes I know cause when I look up in your eyes
(Yeah aye)
Déjà Vu who is this they feelin' every time?
That look you give me every time I'm high
Got some habits, I can't keep them
The same ones that made you hate me
Ho-oh, smokin' potent, high as nose hair
If I were to get lost, bitch would you save me?
Baby would you save me?
Oh, baby would you save me?
(Yeah aye, hold on, babe)
Been thinkin' bout it lately
Oh, thinkin' bout it lately
(Yeah aye, hold on, babe)
Baby would you save me?
Oh, baby, baby, baby
(Yeah aye, hold on, babe)
Been thinkin' bout it lately
Oh, baby, baby, baby
Guess I'm an addict 'cause I'm at it again (oh, oh)
I tried to run, but babe I'm on the southwest (southwest)
(Yeah aye, hold on, babe)
Baby don't you lie to me
Don't you lie to me
(Yeah aye, hold on)
You take all the time you need
(Yeah aye, hold on, babe)
It feels good but it's killing me softly, killing me softly
(Yeah aye, hold on, babe)
Is there anything I can do for you to love me?
(Yeah aye, hold on, babe)
I been feelin' lone, lonely
(Yeah aye, hold on)
I don't think I'll change one day
Got some habits, I can't keep them
The same ones that made you hate me
Ho-oh, smokin' potent, high as nose hair
If I were to get lost, bitch would you save me?
Baby would you save me?
Oh, baby would you save me?
(Yeah aye, hold on, babe)
Been thinkin' bout it lately
Oh, thinkin' bout it lately
(Yeah aye, hold on, babe)
Baby would you save me?
Oh, baby, baby, baby
(Yeah aye, hold on, babe)
Been thinkin' bout it lately
Oh, baby, baby, baby
